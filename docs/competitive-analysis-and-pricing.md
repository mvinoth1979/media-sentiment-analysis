| **Google Business Reviews** | ✅ Live (pending Advanced plan) | Collector enabled; Places ID auto-resolved from brand name on first run and saved to brand_configs. Requires Google Places API (New) **Advanced** SKU enabled in Cloud Console — Essentials plan omits the `reviews` field. Diagnostic logging added for 403/400/missing-reviews key. |
| **Reddit + Google Reviews scheduler fix** | ✅ Live | Critical bug fixed: scheduler.py was silently dropping `google_reviews_enabled`, `google_places_id`, `reddit_enabled`, `reddit_subreddits` from the Redis worker config dict — both channels never ran despite Supabase flags being set. |
| **Competitor SoV entity filter** | ✅ Live | Clicking entity in SoV widget filters mentions by `entities[]` array containment (`.contains("entities", [name])`) instead of fuzzy title ilike search. Full stack: postgres, /dashboard/mentions endpoint, MentionsList `initialEntity` prop. |

| **NLP tier routing + API cost optimisation** | ✅ Live | 4-tier pipeline: Tier 0 code-only (star rating → sentiment, ≤8-word → neutral); Tier 1 Groq free (EN social comments + posts); Tier 2 Gemini free key (EN news articles); Tier 3 Gemini paid key (Indic-language content + AI Summary). Full fallback chain across all providers. Code extractors (states_mentioned, topics, keywords, issue_category) run zero-cost before any LLM call and are merged post-call. Expected: ~69% reduction in paid Gemini calls per pipeline run. |
| **Round-robin Groq key rotation** | ✅ Live | Thread-safe APIRouter class — up to 2 Groq API keys rotate round-robin with per-key rate-limit cooldown tracking (65s on 429). Gemini paid and free clients are similarly tracked. Full fallback: if primary tier rate-limited, auto-falls to next tier. |

## 3. Honest Competitive Assessment

### Where MediaSense Genuinely Leads

**1. Curated Indian news portal depth (unique)**
No competitor maintains a hand-verified list of 43 Indian regional RSS feeds with credibility scores, per-portal keyword filtering, and skip_keyword_filter logic for non-English scripts. Meltwater has a larger news index globally, but India-specific regional portals (Vikatan, Prajavani, Divya Bhaskar, Prabhat Khabar, Sathiyam TV, Dinamalar) are not well-indexed. This is a real and structural advantage — it takes months to build and verify this portal list.

**2. State-level mention tagging via NLP (first mover)**
Locobuzz markets "region-level insight" but there is no verifiable feature behind it. MediaSense uses Gemini to extract Indian states from article prose and filters by state in the Mention Explorer — this is live code, not a marketing claim. No competitor has shipped this verifiably.

**3. AI-grade NLP across 6 Indian languages for news prose**
Locobuzz and Konnect Insights claim vernacular sentiment — but their NLP is trained on short-form social text (tweets, reviews, Hinglish slang). MediaSense uses Gemini 2.0 Flash on long-form news prose, a structurally different and harder task. A Tamil news article from Vikatan is nothing like a Tamil tweet.

**4. Credibility-weighted perception score**
Raw mention counts make a tweet from a 20-follower account equal to an editorial in The Hindu. MediaSense weights by source credibility × reach. Only Brandwatch (at $800–3,000/month) does this. No Indian mid-market tool does.

**5. Agency RBAC architecture**
The 5-role, 3-tier hierarchy (platform / agency / brand) matches exactly how Indian digital agencies operate. Competitors have multi-user features; none have the specific agency_admin → brand_admin → brand_viewer scoping with tenant isolation that MediaSense ships.

**6. Rejection learning**
Deleted articles are remembered. Future pipeline runs automatically skip similar content. No competitor in the mid-market segment has this.

**7. YouTube monitoring at zero marginal cost**
YouTube Data API v3 gives 10,000 units/day free — enough to monitor 12 brands for videos and comments at no cost. MediaSense uses the hybrid approach: free channel RSS for brand-owned channels (no quota cost) + keyword search for competitor mentions. YouTube credibility is tiered by subscriber count and flows into the same perception score formula as news. Competitors charge premium tier prices for YouTube coverage; MediaSense includes it at all price tiers.

**8. Source-type-aware NLP pipeline (news + social in one system)**
YouTube comments require different NLP than news prose — emoji carry sentiment weight, slang is intentional, mixed scripts (Hinglish, Tanglish) are the norm. MediaSense uses separate LLM prompt paths per `source_type`, with a short-text guard for <4-word comments (default neutral, avoids noise). This is the same inference pipeline — no separate social NLP stack, no separate data schema — which keeps the architecture simple and the cost low.

### Where MediaSense Trails Critically

**1. Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook — crisis channels still missing**
YouTube has shipped (Phase 2.0), but Twitter/X, Instagram, and Facebook remain absent. In a brand crisis, the first 30 minutes of spread happen on Twitter. MediaSense captures the YouTube dimension of public opinion (long-form video reactions, comment threads) but misses the fastest-moving signal. This is the most important remaining gap. Phase 3 priority.

*Note: This is a smaller gap now. YouTube comments represent a meaningful share of Indian brand sentiment — especially for sectors like banking, FMCG, telecom — where YouTube is the primary platform for consumer video reviews.*

**2. Hourly batch vs near-real-time**
The fastest competitor delivers alerts in 5–15 minutes. MediaSense delivers data up to 60 minutes stale. For a PR crisis, the difference between 15 minutes and 60 minutes is significant.

**3. ~~No alerts~~ ✅ Fixed (Wave 3)**
Email alerts: perception_score_below, negative_pct_above, mention_spike — per-brand, 4h rate-limit via Resend. Remaining gap: alerts are email-only (no Slack/WhatsApp) and fire after hourly batch, not near-real-time.

**4. ~~No export~~ ✅ Fixed (Wave 3)**
CSV export live — respects all active filters including source_type, up to 2,000 rows. Remaining gap: PDF/PPT branded reports not yet available.

**5. ~~No self-serve onboarding~~ ✅ Fixed (Wave 3 + Phase 2.0)**
4-step wizard (name → keywords → languages → YouTube config), user invite, UserManagement, delete brand, remove user role. Remaining gap: billing/payment flow — cannot charge without Razorpay/Stripe (Wave 4).

**6. Hinglish / Tanglish mixed-script detection**
Locobuzz's ContextualPulse™ specifically markets Hinglish/Tanglish social text handling. MediaSense's YouTube NLP path handles it better than the news path (social-text prompt is emoji and slang-aware), but fasttext langdetect still misclassifies some code-mixed text. Lower priority now that YouTube NLP is handling it gracefully in practice.

---

## 4. Defensible Positioning Statement

> *MediaSense is the only monitoring platform built specifically for Indian regional media — tracking brands across 43 English, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, and Kannada news portals and YouTube, with state-level sentiment filtering and credibility-weighted perception scoring, at mid-market pricing.*

**What to avoid claiming:**
- "The only vernacular sentiment tool" — Locobuzz and Konnect now claim this (for social)
- "Real-time monitoring" — hourly batch is not real-time
- "Complete brand monitoring solution" — Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook still missing

**What to lean into:**
- News + YouTube intelligence in one unified dashboard (news NLP + social NLP, same pipeline)
- Regional India depth (43 curated portals, not generic web crawl)
- State-level granularity (live feature, no competitor has it verifiably)
- YouTube reach analytics (view/like counts visible alongside sentiment)
- Agency-grade multi-brand architecture at mid-market price

**Best-fit buyer:** PR and communications teams in brands with significant regional/South India presence; digital agencies wanting to win vernacular monitoring mandates; brands in telecom, banking, FMCG sectors where YouTube reviews are a meaningful signal.

**Weakest-fit buyer:** Brand teams looking for a single tool replacing their current social listening setup (Twitter/Instagram-heavy).

## 5. Pricing Recommendation

### Market Reference Points

| Tool | Price | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Manual news clipping agencies (India) | ₹5,000–15,000/brand/month | English + some vernacular clipping, manual, next-day delivery |
| Mention (entry-level global) | ₹3,400–12,400/month | Social + web, English sentiment, no Indian vernacular |
| Brand24 | ₹6,600–24,900/month | Social + web, English, 25 mentions/country |
| Konnect Insights | ₹15,000–60,000/brand/month | Social + news, basic vernacular claims |
| Locobuzz | ₹20,000–80,000/brand/month | Social + news + CRM, vernacular social claims |
| Meltwater (India contracts) | ₹40,000–1,25,000/month | Global news + social, English-grade NLP |
| Brandwatch | ₹65,000–2,50,000/month | Full social intelligence, no Indian vernacular |

- 1 brand
- English + 1 regional language (customer's choice)
- All portals for chosen languages
- **YouTube monitoring included** (keyword search + comments)
- 5 dashboard users
- 90-day article history
- Dashboard only (no CSV export)

*Justification:* Undercuts manual clipping services (₹5,000–15,000) while delivering AI-grade analysis, a live dashboard, and YouTube monitoring. Accessible entry point for first-time buyers.

---

#### Tier 2 — News Professional *(₹14,000/month per brand)*
Target: Mid-market brands with pan-India or multi-state presence; PR managers
- 1 brand
- All 6 languages (EN/TA/HI/GU/BN/KN)

- State-level filtering
- 10 dashboard users
- 12-month article history
- CSV export ✅
- Email alerts (3 types) ✅
- Monthly PDF summary report (Wave 4 — not yet available)

*Justification:* Positioned against Konnect/Locobuzz entry tier (₹15,000–20,000/month) but with far superior language depth and YouTube coverage included at no premium. Brands currently paying Meltwater ₹40,000+/month for English-only news will find this compelling.

---

#### Tier 3 — Agency *(₹45,000/month for up to 5 brands)*
Target: Digital agencies managing multiple brand accounts
- Up to 5 brands (= ₹9,000/brand/month — agency margin opportunity vs Tier 2)

Locobuzz agency plans start at ₹40,000–60,000/month for comparable brand counts with basic YouTube. MediaSense is price-competitive with better vernacular depth and YouTube analytics at all tiers.

---

#### Tier 4 — Enterprise *(Custom, starting ₹1,20,000/month)*

Export, alerts, self-serve onboarding, RBAC management, and YouTube monitoring are all live. MediaSense is now feature-complete for news + YouTube monitoring. **Move to full pricing.** The Founder Pricing window has passed.

**Current recommended pricing:**

| Tier | Price | Ready to sell? |
|---|---|---|
| News + YouTube Essentials | ₹6,500/month | ✅ Yes — pending billing integration |
| News + YouTube Professional | ₹14,000/month | ✅ Yes — pending billing integration |
| Agency (5 brands, news + YouTube) | ₹45,000/month | ✅ Yes — pending billing integration |

**Only blocker before first invoice:** Razorpay / Stripe billing integration (Wave 4). Can currently be handled manually (bank transfer / invoice) for the first 2–3 customers.

#### After Phase 2.1 (Reddit added)
Add Reddit to existing tiers at no price increase. Update positioning to "news + YouTube + Reddit" — the three free-API social channels. This completes the picture for brand discovery and public opinion tracking.

#### After Phase 3 (Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook added)
Reprice significantly upward. Add a **Full Social + News** tier at ₹30,000–45,000/month per brand — this directly competes with Locobuzz/Konnect's core offering at a comparable price but with better language depth.

| Tier | Price (post-Twitter/Instagram/Facebook) |
|---|---|
| News + YouTube Professional | ₹16,000/month |
| Full Social + News Standard (1 brand) | ₹35,000/month |
| Full Social + News Pro (6 languages) | ₹50,000/month |
| Agency (5 brands, all channels) | ₹1,40,000/month |

## 7. Go-to-Market Priorities Before First Sale

|---|---|---|
| ~~Self-serve brand + user onboarding~~ | ✅ Done | 4-step wizard, user invite, delete brand, remove user role — all shipped |

| ~~Alert / email notification~~ | ✅ Done | 3 alert types, 4h rate-limit, Resend email delivery |

| **Billing integration (Razorpay / Stripe India)** | ❌ Not started | **Critical — cannot charge customers without payment flow** |
| **Stable Vercel production URL** | ⚠️ In progress | Add canonical domain alias in Vercel dashboard — current URL changes on each deploy |
| Terms of service + privacy policy | ❌ Not started | Required for any paid SaaS |
| Supabase row limits | ⚠️ Monitor | Free tier caps at 50,000 rows; YouTube + news at 12 brands accelerates this |
